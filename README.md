# GrecFitnessClub
Website for a fictional gym. For personal portofolio.

### To properly run the website on your local machine:

`npm install` - To install all dependencies / modules

`npm start` - To run development server on your local machine (`localhost`)

`npm run build` - To get all production files

##### I used the following technologies for this project:

- Webpack
  - Babel
  - Html / Javascript / Css - minified files
  - Webpack dev server ( for development )
- Sass
- Media Queries ( Responsive Design )
- Vanilla Javascript + Jump.js Library for smooth scroll
- Semantic HTML5

**Refresh the page and Resize page to 100% after choosing responsive device (Dumb chrome have bugs and can ruin my website review)**
